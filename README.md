# learning-webscrape
Simple project to learn webscraping.

This project uses Python and the BeautifulSoup library. As the purpose of this project was to introduce myself to webscraping, there are a few hardcoded variables in the code.

This project scrapes Stock symbols from finviz's screener into an excel file that's compatible to be uploaded into the ThinkOrSwim trading platform. The uploaded symbols can then be interpreted conveniently using the platform.
